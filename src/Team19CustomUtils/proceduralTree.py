    #the goal of procedural generation is to conserve computer resources and generate the tree only as required.
    #due to the unique constraints of the situation, that being the user is not able to perform backwards manipulation,
    #preceding portions of the tree can be "forgotten" and future paths are generated as-needed
    #using computer memory for this task makes for a simple solution as the code already operates upon memory by default

    #this allows for the loading of extremely high-dimension matrices with unknown projected memory sizes to be
    #represented with a predetermined amount of memory space using lower-dimension local representations
    #specifically, the parts of the larger matrix loaded composes of a "present" buffer and a "look-ahead buffer"

    #this is most often used in games featuring linear progression (ie. the player can only move forward to the next map, level, etc.)
    #this is also another reason why most of these games do not feature extensive save capabilities and instead opt for gameplay loops 
    #as any saved data would probably be invalid due to a limited amount of memory being alternated to compress data
